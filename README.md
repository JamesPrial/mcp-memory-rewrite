# Knowledge Graph Memory Server (Go Implementation with SQLite)

A Go implementation of the MCP memory server using SQLite for persistent storage, providing enhanced performance and reliability over the original JSON-based implementation.

## Key Improvements

This Go implementation offers several advantages over the original TypeScript version:

- **SQLite Backend**: ACID-compliant database with better performance for large datasets
- **Full-Text Search**: Leverages SQLite FTS5 for advanced search capabilities
- **Concurrent Access**: SQLite handles multiple readers with proper locking
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and transactions ensure consistency
- **Efficient Queries**: Indexed columns and optimized SQL queries
- **Smaller Memory Footprint**: Go's efficient memory management

## Core Concepts

### Entities
Entities are the primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:
- A unique name (identifier)
- An entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "event")
- A list of observations

Example:
```json
{
  "name": "John_Smith",
  "entityType": "person",
  "observations": ["Speaks fluent Spanish"]
}
```

### Relations
Relations define directed connections between entities. They are always stored in active voice and describe how entities interact or relate to each other.

Example:
```json
{
  "from": "John_Smith",
  "to": "Anthropic",
  "relationType": "works_at"
}
```

### Observations
Observations are discrete pieces of information about an entity. They are:
- Stored as strings
- Attached to specific entities
- Can be added or removed independently
- Should be atomic (one fact per observation)

Example:
```json
{
  "entityName": "John_Smith",
  "observations": [
    "Speaks fluent Spanish",
    "Graduated in 2019",
    "Prefers morning meetings"
  ]
}
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- SQLite3 (included with most systems)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jamesprial/mcp-memory-rewrite.git
cd mcp-memory-rewrite

# Build the server
go build -o mcp-memory-server ./cmd/mcp-memory-server

# Or install directly
go install ./cmd/mcp-memory-server
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `MEMORY_DB_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file (default: `~/.mcp-memory/memory.db`)

## API

### Tools

- **create_entities**
  - Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph
  - Input: `entities` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `name` (string): Entity identifier
      - `entityType` (string): Type classification
      - `observations` (string[]): Associated observations
  - Ignores entities with existing names

- **create_relations**
  - Create multiple new relations between entities
  - Input: `relations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `from` (string): Source entity name
      - `to` (string): Target entity name
      - `relationType` (string): Relationship type in active voice
  - Skips duplicate relations

- **add_observations**
  - Add new observations to existing entities
  - Input: `observations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `entityName` (string): Target entity
      - `contents` (string[]): New observations to add
  - Returns added observations per entity
  - Fails if entity doesn't exist

- **delete_entities**
  - Remove entities and their relations
  - Input: `entityNames` (string[])
  - Cascading deletion of associated relations
  - Silent operation if entity doesn't exist

- **delete_observations**
  - Remove specific observations from entities
  - Input: `deletions` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `entityName` (string): Target entity
      - `observations` (string[]): Observations to remove
  - Silent operation if observation doesn't exist

- **delete_relations**
  - Remove specific relations from the graph
  - Input: `relations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `from` (string): Source entity name
      - `to` (string): Target entity name
      - `relationType` (string): Relationship type
  - Silent operation if relation doesn't exist

- **read_graph**
  - Read the entire knowledge graph
  - No input required
  - Returns complete graph structure with all entities and relations

- **search_nodes**
  - Search for nodes based on query
  - Input: `query` (string)
  - Searches across:
    - Entity names
    - Entity types
    - Observation content
  - Uses SQLite FTS5 for efficient full-text search
  - Returns matching entities and their relations

- **open_nodes**
  - Retrieve specific nodes by name
  - Input: `names` (string[])
  - Returns:
    - Requested entities
    - Relations between requested entities
  - Silently skips non-existent nodes

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### Direct Binary

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-memory-server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Go Run

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "go",
      "args": ["run", "github.com/jamesprial/mcp-memory-rewrite/cmd/mcp-memory-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## VS Code Installation

Add the configuration to your MCP configuration file:

**User Configuration (Recommended)**
Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run `MCP: Open User Configuration`.

**Workspace Configuration**
Alternatively, add to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-memory-server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## System Prompt

Here is an example prompt for chat personalization. You could use this prompt in the "Custom Instructions" field of a Claude.ai Project:

```
Follow these steps for each interaction:

1. User Identification:
   - You should assume that you are interacting with default_user
   - If you have not identified default_user, proactively try to do so.

2. Memory Retrieval:
   - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph
   - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"

3. Memory
   - While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     a) Basic Identity (age, gender, location, job title, education level, etc.)
     b) Behaviors (interests, habits, etc.)
     c) Preferences (communication style, preferred language, etc.)
     d) Goals (goals, targets, aspirations, etc.)
     e) Relationships (personal and professional relationships up to 3 degrees of separation)

4. Memory Update:
   - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory as follows:
     a) Create entities for recurring organizations, people, and significant events
     b) Connect them to the current entities using relations
     c) Store facts about them as observations
```

## Database Schema

The SQLite database uses the following schema:

### Tables

**entities**
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` (TEXT UNIQUE)
- `entity_type` (TEXT)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**observations**
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
- `entity_id` (INTEGER FOREIGN KEY)
- `content` (TEXT)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**relations**
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
- `from_entity_id` (INTEGER FOREIGN KEY)
- `to_entity_id` (INTEGER FOREIGN KEY)
- `relation_type` (TEXT)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### Full-Text Search Tables

- `entities_fts` - FTS5 virtual table for entity search
- `observations_fts` - FTS5 virtual table for observation search

## Building with Docker

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev sqlite-dev
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o mcp-memory-server ./cmd/mcp-memory-server

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache sqlite
COPY --from=builder /app/mcp-memory-server /usr/local/bin/
VOLUME ["/data"]
ENV MEMORY_DB_PATH=/data/memory.db
ENTRYPOINT ["mcp-memory-server"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t mcp-memory-server .
docker run -i -v mcp-memory-data:/data mcp-memory-server
```

## Migration from JSON

If you have an existing JSON memory file from the original TypeScript implementation, you can migrate it using the included migration tool (to be implemented).

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | JSON Implementation | SQLite Implementation |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
